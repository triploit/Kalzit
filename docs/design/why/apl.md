# Why is it good to be similar to APL?

* It has basically no boilerplate code
* Once you understand the [array-based](/docs/design/why/arrayProgramming.md) concept and the [right-to-left evaluation](/docs/design/why/operatorPrecedence.md), you basically know the language (except the [library](/docs/api/home), which you can easily learn when you need it)
* It has very little potential for breaking programs (As far as I know, things like infinite while loops are not possible)

# What is bad about the original APL (as a programmer)?

* It was not designed for typing, so it contains many weird symbols.
* While usually being short, APL code is often hard to understand for someone who does not know the language.
* It is not exactly great suited for use on the web or for GUI applications

# What does this language do better?

* It is designed for the web and able to run on most platforms, because it is implemented in JavaScript
* It is rather simple to implement GUIs with it (at least certain kinds), which makes it a compelling option
* You can type it with your normal keyboard, and using the symbols you already know
* You are probably able to read and sort-of understand most programs written in it, without having to know a thing about the language itself
