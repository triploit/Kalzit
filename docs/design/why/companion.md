# Why would you want two languages as companions?

Not a single programming language is perfect.
One might be better or worse than the other, but usually that is only true for some specific areas.
If a perfect programming language had been invented, it would also probably be in use today, and overshadow all the others.
The interesting thing is that there is no language which everybody can code in.
Closest to that are things like Java, C and Python, which are fairly common, but by no means perfect.

This basically means that there does not seem to be a perfect programming language, and I do not think that such a thing will ever exist.
The idea of designing a language as a companion to the popular ones comes from this realization.
So, instead of trying to invent some magical thing that is better than everything else, I decided to invent something that just avoids the annoyances of the most popular languages.

That approach might even lead to a sort of high adoption rate, because it enables a programmer to choose the right language for the current task.
If you want to create a website with an image gallery, for example, you might want to write most of it using HTML and JavaScript. But then, you might realize that it is rather annoying to implement an image gallery in JavaScript, so you could use this new language instead.

Being a companion language means that this language is not a daunting thing that everybody has to learn, but it can possibly make coding with your usual language of choice much easier.
