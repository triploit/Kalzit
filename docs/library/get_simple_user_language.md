# get_simple_user_language
## argumentList

## comment

Returns a simple (two-letter) code which represents the language of the current user.
For example, if the system language is set to English, it will return "en".

This simplified version differs from the one which "!getUserLanguage" might return, because that one can include more detailed information (for example, "en_US" would indicate American English).

Usage example:
$lang = !getSimpleUserLanguage.
