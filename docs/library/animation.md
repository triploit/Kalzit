## comment

Defines a simple animation with a given duration.
An animation is a media object, so you can play it like this:
play: animation.
By default, the animation will not do anything. To change that, you could do something like:
($setOnProgress propOf animation): {`your action`}.
To learn more about controllable media, please look at the "MediaController" function.
