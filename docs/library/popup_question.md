# popup_question
## comment

Shows the given text in a dialog box with an input field both a "confirm" and a "close" option.
If the user selects "confirm", the text that was written into the input field is returned. If "close" is selected, this function returns "void".

Usage example:
print: "You typed this: " + popupQuestion: "You can type something".

The code execution will pause here until the user closed the dialog.
