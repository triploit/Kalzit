# registered_desktop_tools
## comment

A modifiable list that contains all the tools that are supposed to be added to a desktop toolbar.
Such a bar can be generated using "uiGlobalToolbar", or "generateDesktopToolbar" if you want to be more specific.

A tool should not (!) be added by directly modifying this list. Instead, please use "registerDesktopTool" for that.
In the documentation for that function, you can also see how a desktop tool is built.
