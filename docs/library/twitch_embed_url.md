# twitch_embed_url
## comment

The main Twitch player URL, with a "/?" added to it.
If you are interested in generating player URLs, consider using the following options:
"twitchChannelEmbedUrl", "twitchVideoEmbedUrl" or "twitchCollectionEmbedUrl".

In case you want to create a Twitch player to embed in your UI, take a look at the "uiTwitch...Player" functions
(there are specific ones for channels, videos and collections).
