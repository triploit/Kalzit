# ui_action_picker
## comment

Has basically the same effect as "uiIndexPicker".
TODO: At the moment this function is implemented natively, but it should be rewritten soon. Two redundant pieces of code should not exist in the same project.

Please use [uiIndexPicker](/services/documentation/uiIndexPicker) instead.
