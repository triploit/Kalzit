# product

Multiplies the values inside an array.
This works for arrays with string values as well - these are simply converted to numbers.

Example with only numbers:
product: 1;2;3
`Result: 6`

Be careful with arrays that contain the number 0 or string "0" - this will make sure that the result is 0 as well.
