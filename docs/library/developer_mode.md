# developer_mode
## comment

Contains true (1) if developer mode is active, and false (0) if it is not.
You can activate developer mode by storing "true" (the string) with the key "kalzit.devmode" and reloading the page.

Developer mode is intended to allow you to test your in-progress features, while still allowing other users to use the stable ones.
