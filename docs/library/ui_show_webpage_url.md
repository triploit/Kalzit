# ui_show_webpage_url
## comment

Takes an URL and creates a UI element that shows the referenced website.

For example, if you want to show the "README" file of this project in your app, you could do this:
```kalzit
print: uiShowWebpageUrl: "/README.md".
```

Please note that some websites might prevent you from embedding them.
