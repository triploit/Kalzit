# speech_get_voices
## comment

Returns a list of all available voices (represented by their name as a string).
This is probably not useful because there is no way to get any information about a voice (yet?).
So this function might be removed in later versions.

Usage example:

```kalzit
$allVoices = !speechGetVoices.
```
