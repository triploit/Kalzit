Takes a list of positive integers and returns all numbers these are divisible by.

For example, the numbers 8 and 16 are all divisible by 2, 4 and 8.
Of course, 1 would always work, so that is excluded from the result.

So, this example will produce the expected result:
divisors: 8;16.
`Result: 2;4;8`
