# volume
## argumentList
_volumeController
## comment

Returns the current volume of an audio controller (any medium with sound). This is done by calling its $getVolume property.
A volume value should generally range from 0 (not audible) to 1 (the loudest).

The medium needs to be specified as the first parameter.
