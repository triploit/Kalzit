# Guidelines for Internet privacy

## Control
* Nothing must leave the Intranet (or home network) without user consent
	* Consent needs to be conscious (by means of an easy to understand and short Yes-No question)
	* Consent needs to be differenciated (not "all or nothing", but rather the user has to be asked for each domain)
	* There have to be multiple options (different amounts of time: Never; Until I close the app; As long as I am logged in; Always)
	* It has to be possible to change the settings later and revoke permissions

## Transparency
* The user has to be able to know how an app uses the Internet
	* The exact Internet addresses (including server handles) should never be saved, but the domains should, so the user can understand what happened
	* All saved activity logs have to be accessible to the user
	* There has to be an option to delete these logs consciously
	* The deletion has to be conscious
