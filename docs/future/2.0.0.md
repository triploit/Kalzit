This is a little list of things that are planned for Kalzit version 2.0.0

## Make things faster
This is a very generic goal, so here are some approaches:
* Cache files that do not change on the server
* Prefer asynchronous data loading over synchronous loading
* Regularly fetch (potentially changing) internet resources in the background for quicker access when they are needed

## Cloud functionality
It should be simple to ...
* ... upload files to a Kalzit server
* ... view the uploaded files
* ... automatically download certain files to any device you want to (for this release, only a Desktop version of this is planned - mobile platforms are a bit more special)

## Searching the server
With the implementation of "Cloud functionality", there could be a lot of files on a Kalzit server. It would be nice if you could ...
* ... search the entire server for files (by name, metadata, and quickly)
* ... search other content (for example, if someone creates a new Kalzit app, content generated with that should show up in the results if appropriate)

## Your feedback is very welcome

If you like one of the planned points and want to see it very soon, or if you think another one is not important - please tell me.
Also, if you have any other idea regarding this project, or if you have found a bug, please open an issue on GitHub.

Anyway, thank you for being interested in Kalzit - have fun with it!
