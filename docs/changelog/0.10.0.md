# Kalzit Version 0.10.0 - Changelog
Hey there! This is another release of Kalzit, and the project has reached version 10! (Actually version 0.10, but you get the idea - there have been a few versions).
This version is a little bit special, because it is going to break some of the apps you might have written. The breaking changes are listed in the first section. Let's just start with them:

## Breaking changes (for developers)
### In the future: all apps need to be their own project
This first change is not present right now, but it might be soon. In future versions, it might not be possible to run a `.k` file as a web app.
So in the future, you are not going to be able to simply put a `.k` file somewhere and run it as a web app - you will need to create a separate app project.
The good thing is that this is not hard by any means - just run the following command to create an app project:  `./cli new app /absolute/path/to/app/folder appId`.
In this version, you might notice that some APIs do not work with simple, single-file web apps. This is normal and fully expected - the APIs should work well with an app project.

### Removed special features of the "apps" folder
This is probably the biggest breaking change. In previous version of Kalzit, you could just place a file in the `/apps` folder and run it as a web app. For example, if you had a file called `myApp.k` and placed it inside of the `/apps` folder, you could access it with an URL that looked like this: `http://localhost:5000/app/myApp`.
Notice that this does not make too much sense if you don't know it. Why should I put `/app/` in the URL (without an s) when the folder with my file inside it is called `apps`, *with* an s? And why do I not need a file extension?
This behavior was confusing, and it was hard-coded into the server, so with every request it had to check for this specific `/app` case. Not ideal. So, in an attempt to make the server more predictable and faster, this special case was removed. The `/apps` folder is now just a normal folder.

What does this mean for you as a developer? Firstly, you can still use your apps. You can still put a `.k` file into the `/apps` folder, but you can now access it using `https://localhost:5000/apps/myApp.k` - with the s and the file extension. Also, the `/app` handle still works, because the installer script will automatically create a symbolic link which ensures that everything in the `/apps` folder is also available in the `/app` folder. These folders are quite literally the same thing.
If you want your app to be available just like before, the best option would be to create a standalone project for it. You can run `./cli new app /absolute/path/to/app/folder appId` to set up your project. The folder should be outside of the main Kalzit folder.
Then you can have your code in that new folder and manage it however you want to - you could set up a Git repository, for example. Having an external app project is recommended for all apps, because it makes things like customizing and managing Kalzit apps a lot easier. Future versions of Kalzit will rely on external app projects for updating, so if you want your app to "survive" a Kalzit update, you should make it into its own project and store it outside of the main Kalzit project.

Okay, now that we have this big change covered, here are a few smaller ones.

### Removed the entire concept of .redirect files from the server
This is a quick one. In previous versions, files with the `.redirect` file extension were treated in a special way. But essentially, there were supposed to do the same thing as symbolic links.
So why re-invent symbolic links if they already exist? That is why redirect files are no longer a thing. You can still use them as a way to create symbolic links, but other than that, they are treated like normal files.
If you want to convert all `.redirect` files in the Kalzit folder into symbolic links, just run `bash ./getRidOfRedirects.sh`.

### Removed the services functionality from the server
Previously, there was another hard-coded feature called "services". A service was essentially a Kalzit file which pretended to be a folder. So, if you had a service called `stuff`, and you used the url `http://localhost:5000/service/stuff/abc`, the service would be called.
This was very intransparent because you could never really know if an URL was pointing to a service file or to a folder. Also, services were pretty much never used by anything in the project, so they did not need to exist.
Once again, this is another thing that makes the server faster by removing an unnecessary check which needed to run with each request.

### Transitioned the /api endpoint to a regular folder
Yet another thing that was hard-coded previously. I think you get the idea - but this actually only matters for server-side Kalzit API developers, which probably do not exist yet. For client-side apps, everything works the same as before. Kalzit server-side APIs are now located in the [/api](/api) folder.

### Updated the homescreen data format
This is relevant when your app wants to have a home-screen icon (visible when you click on the "apps" button in the toolbar, or when you open the base server url).
Essentially, every app project can now define its own home screen icon. Each app can set a title, color, and image for itself. Also, you can set if it is an app just for developers, or for normal users.
The way you do this is by adding a JSON file to your app project, at `<project>/config/home.json`. The contents should look a bit like this:

```
{
	"id":"appId",
	"title":"My app title",
	"icon":"relative/path/to/app/icon.png",
	"dev":false
}
```

This defines a home screen icon with a given title and image. It also tells Kalzit that the icon should be visible for all users, not just for developers.
The cool thing about this is that by building your apps (with `./cli build apps`), the home screen will automatically be updated, and your app will be easily available from all the other apps. You just need that one JSON file!

### Changed the name of some files
* The server file is now located at `/nodejs/files/httpServer.k`. It did not have the `.k` file extension previously.
* The API documentation files are now located at `/docs/library`, not at `/docs/jsLibrary`.

## New language features
This is probably a bit more interesting than the section above. Kalzit does now have two very useful big new language features.

### Call stack
The first feature I want to mention is a call stack. Basically this means that every time you call a function in Kalzit, this is remembered somewhere. So, when an error occurs, we can know which function calls lead to that error. Many people know this as a stack trace, and it helps very much with debugging code. It is a long overdue feature, but now it exists in Kalzit too!

The way this feature was implemented is kind of nice as well. Whenever an error happens, a simplified call stack will be shown on the webpage itself. This makes sure that the user is aware of the error, but it is not too threatening at the same time:

![Screenshot of an error message on a website](/docs/images/0.10.0/callStackOnWebpage.png)

For developers who need as much detail as possible, the call stack is also shown in the developer tools console. Here, you can see the Kalzit call stack (similar to what you get on the webpage), but you can also inspect every called function and see the arguments passed to it.
Also, you get the JavaScript call stack to find what function cauesd the error, as well as a useful hint at the bottom as to what JS function is most likely to have caused the problem. This is very helpful if you need to find a bug, and because it is shown in the browser developer tools, a lot of the inspection stuff comes for free! Here is what the same error from above would look like in the developer console:

![Screenshot of an error message in the developer console](/docs/images/0.10.0/callStackOnConsole.png)

This new way of dealing with errors is much friendlier than the previous one for both users and developers. With earlier versions, the user was presented with a very large and unintelligible chunk of text that did not even contain a lot of useful information.

### Arrow syntax

The second big language feature is a new arrow syntax. It works in conjunction with the `!function` syntax that existed before.
I think the easiest way to show what the arrow syntax does is to show two pieces of code that do the same thing:

```
`First option`
!fileWrite "path.txt" "Content".

`Second option`
!fileWrite "Content" -> "path.txt".
```

The arrow switches the two things on each side of it. When we have `a b -> c d`, we get `a c b d` as the result. This is useful for all sorts of things, like "for-each" loops:
```
`With the arrow syntax - very natural`
$items = 1;2;3.
!loopEach items -> {
    print: x
}.

`Without the arrow syntax - not natural`
{
    print: x
} loopEach items.
```

The nice thing is that this new addition is fully optional - everything works as it did before if you do not want to use the arrows, and you can accomplish anything you want to do in Kalzit without them! But in some cases, as you saw above, they can make reading and writing code a lot easier.

## Server changes
There have been a lot of changes to the server. Some of the most significant ones are already listed in the ["breaking-changes-for-developers"](#breaking-changes-for-developers) section.
However, there are many other changes, so we will talk about the biggest ones.

### User data zip API
As you know if you read the [readme](/README.md) of this project, Kalzit is supposed to be home server software. One problem here is that with a single server, there is no easy way to have redundant backups of your data, which means it is quite possible to lose it when the server crashes.
The first thing that was implemented to solve this problem is an API to download a ZIP file from the server, which contains your user files. This API is called `/api/nocache/mediadown/userArchive`.
You can begin the download with `/api/nocache/mediadown/userArchive/begin?session=<session>`, check if it is done with `/api/nocache/mediadown/userArchive/check?session=<session>`, and actually download the generated file using `/api/nocache/mediadown/userArchive/stream?session=<session>`.
This is obviously not enough to solve the problem of safe and redundant data storage, but it is a very little step in that direction - at least you now have an option do download a copy of your data. More work on this will be done in future versions.

### User files support multiple versions
The Kalzit server has an API called `/api/special/upload` which allows you to upload files. There is a demo app called [ul.k](/ul.k) inside this project, which shows you a way to upload files with that API.
In this version of Kalzit, the uploaded files can have multiple versions. Whenever you try to overwrite a file that exists, a new version is created - and the old version stays, without the user noticing it. This is very useful if you want to restore an old file later.
To support this "versions" feature, the way files are stored needed to be updated. If you want to transition your files to this new file structure, run [this file (migrateFileStructureToV2.txt)](/migrateFileStructureToV2.txt) as a Kalzit script (`cli run nodeApp <full file path>`). After that, everything should work as it did before.

### Some other changes
* Logs are no longer removed on server startup - makes it easier to debug server crashes or other server-related problems
* Better use of ETag when accessing user resources (not hashed on the fly, instead the file version numbers are used - this is much faster)

## Manual timeouts and login requirements
Kalzit was made for rich web-applications. They can be really nice to use, so you could end up using them for really long periods of time. You might have noticed that sites like YouTube, for example, can be sort of addicting. So if you find yourself in a situation like that, what do you do?

Well, every Kalzit app that uses the standard toolbar does now give you an easy option to get a little break. When you open your account panel, you will now see this popup:

![Screenshot of the "i need a break right now" button](/docs/images/0.10.0/needABreakButton.png)

If you push the "I need a break right now" button, the app will activate a timeout - similar to what you would get if you had the checkbox above enabled. So if you push that button, the app will prevent you from using any of the Kalzit apps for the next 20 minutes. That should be enough time to get away from the computer and do something else; this button can really help you with your time management.
The nice thing about timeouts is this: it is not very easy to get around them. A timeout is connected to your account, so if you activate it on one device, you also can not use the Kalzit apps on another device you are logged in to.
Sure, you could log out of your account or use a private window. But this is only possible if the app allows it, because apps can now request a login if you want to use them. This is done by calling the `preventAppUseWithoutLogin` function (at the end of your app code). Any app that does this will only be usable with a login. Calling this function is recommended for all entertainment apps.
I think these features might help some people - myself included - to use their computer or phone a little less than before. Which is probably a good thing.

## Most important API changes
As a programming language, Kalzit has many standard functions which you can use to make applications. This collection of functions is steadily evolving, which is why this release introduces a few major new APIs:

### View-based apps
Applications that use multiple views (or "perspectives") are very common. Say you have a feed reader application that supports multiple news sources - every news source could have its own view that shows its content, and when the source is selected the view should appear where some other feed was previously. Or if you have an image organizer app, every image collection (albums, favourites, etc.) could have its own view, and if the collection is opened the view should appear and replace the other.
There are probably many other examples as well, but I think you get the idea - you want to have a view which can be replaced by another one, without too much effort.

Kalzit does now have a special API to make this as easy as possible: the `viewBasedAppManager`. If you want a quick example for how to use it, here you go:

```
`Create the view manager`
$manager = viewBasedAppManager:
    [$viewDefinitions; [
        ["First view"; uiContainer: "I am the first thing you see!"];
        ["Second view"; uiContainer: "Wow, this is the second view. Crazy."]
    ]];
    [$changeViewTitle; "Pick a view (mobile)..."].

`Show your app UI`
toolAtLeft: do: $getTool propOf manager.
print: !uiGlobalToolbar.
print: $mainView propOf manager.
```

### Modifiable lists support multiple listeners
Modifiable lists are a great way to store, remove and add bits of data. What makes them very useful is that you can attach listeners, which can notify you when the list changes. As an example, you could update a view if a list changes, so that it reflects the list contents properly at all times.
In previous versions, you could attach exactly one listener to each of the supported events - if you wanted to react to general list changes, you could have exactly one function for that, and if you wanted to use another one, it replaced the old one. This was bad when different parts of the program tried to attach listeners - only the most recently added one was triggered.
This problem was solved with this version, because now you can have multiple listeners for the same list event. As an example, you could do something like this:

```
$items = ModifiableList: ().
($setOnChange propOf items): {print: "First listener"}.
($setOnChange propOf items): {print: "Second listener"}.

`Triggers both listeners`
($push propOf items): 1.
```

All of the added listeners will trigger whenever the list changes. This will also work for `$setOnAddition` and `$setOnRemoval`.

### Interchangeable global toolbars
Many Kalzit apps have a toolbar at the top, which allows you to access common app functions or your user account.
In some apps, however, one toolbar at the top might not be enough - you might want to have different toolbars for different app functions. If, for example, you have an image manager with some editing capability, you might want to have one set of tools for editing a single image, and another one for managing a collection of images. These tools could show up or hide depending on what the user is doing in the app.

So, how do you create a second global toolbar, and how do you replace the currently active one with the new one?
Well, say hello to another "manager" function! The manager functions already work really well for creating sidebars and view-based apps, and now the global toolbars can be handled in a similar way.
To create a global-like toolbar, you can do something like this:

```
$manager = !toolLayoutManager.
($setToolsAtLeft propOf manager):
    `just add your tools here`
    "Click me" buttonTool {}.

`You can also use $setToolsAtRight`
`The setup is really similar to the standard "toolsAtLeft" and "toolsAtRight" functions`
```

You could activate that toolbar like this:

```
`We tell the app to have a global toolbar - nothing to do with the manager yet`
print: !uiGlobalToolbar.

`We tell the manager to create a desktop toolbar overlay. We put that in a reference - this makes sure the UI actually updates`
globalDesktopToolbarRef = $getDesktopToolbarOverlay propOf manager.

`Now we just need to update the mobile "hamburger" menu to also use the new set of tools`
do: $applyMobileTools propOf manager.
```

These two pieces of code allow you to create a completely different global toolbar, and you can have as many of them as you want! Also, you can use any other kind of toolbar overlay you like.
This feature will be especially useful for more complex apps, similar to sidebars and view managers.

## End
