Instead of a long introduction, let's just start with the changelog! Because the complete list of changes would be rather uninteresting, here are some of the highlights.

# Less waiting
This one does not need much explaining. The process of interpreting and executing Kalzit code is now a noticeable bit faster, which means that the programs which are written in the Kalzit programming language are faster as well.
But that is only a small part of the story. Many standard APIs were changed as well, so they achieve the same effect while doing less work. As a simple example, you might notice that the "Account" panel opens a bit faster.
This is not particularly relevant when you are using a fast device, but it makes the experience *much* better (or less bad) when you are using a slow device. Performance is still not great, but it is a step in the right direction.

# Less (synchronous) network requests
Network requests can be fast or slow, depending on the server and also on the client device.
In testing, it became clear that one big thing which can make Kalzit apps feel slow are these network requests - especially if you are using a very cheap computer as your server. To address this problem, the following things were done:

- Commonly used pieces of data are written directly into the generated HTML files - one big request instead of many small ones.
- Many functions that used synchronous loading have asynchronous variants (login and register, for example)

This means that, in many cases, you do not have to wait now when you did before. This can be very noticeable with apps that are localized, for example, because the localization data was loaded using a separate network request.
However, when there *needs* to be a network request, that request should be asynchronous. Meaning the user can still use the app while something is loading in the background, rather than having to wait until that loading is done.

In an attempt to do that, many APIs which rely on synchronous loading do now have an asynchronous counterpart. This should make it much easier to transition to asynchronous loading - which, in turn, makes your apps feel much more responsive, because the user can interact with them while they are loading content.

# UI APIs
As you might have noticed, this is a rather user-centric release. Why not improve the user interface itself? Firstly, there are some slight tweaks which make the apps behave better - but I will not talk about those, since they are designed to not feel special or be noticed.

The second thing is probably much more interesting, especially for developers: there are more UI APIs now.
As an example, you can show a simple search panel like this:

```
uiShowPopup: uiPopup: uiSearchPanel: {
	`In here, we can produce our search results!`
	$searchTerm = x.
	
	`This value will be returned and shown as the result`
	uiContainer: "Display search results for '" + searchTerm + "' here."
}.
```
Here is a screenshot of the search panel:

You might have noticed that some of the texts there have been localized already, while others have not. It is a work in progress, but it still works well.

# Session invalidation on logout
Kalzit is intended to be privacy-focused. So far, not many steps were taken in that direction. In this release, the logout process was made a bit better.
Essentially, every successful login creates a so-called session string. Using that session string, you can access your account without needing to re-enter a password.
While that is very convenient (you do not have to enter your password every time, instead you can stay logged in), it is also a security risk. If someone has your session string - even if they just guessed it randomly - they can get access to your account. That is not great by any means.

One partial solution is to invalidate sessions when appropriate. Because if a session string is invalid, you can not do anything with it even if you *do* have it. Yay!
What happens is that your session is now invalidated when you log out. So the session will only be usable as long as you need it. Also, if you restart the server, all active sessions will become invalid.

---
So these are the most important changes in this release. Hopefully you like them!
