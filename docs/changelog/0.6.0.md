This release includes many changes.
Because I want to keep the changelog reasonably long (or short), some of them will not be included here.
However, if you want to get a general understanding of the big changes, here you go.

# New features
## Automatic HTTPS support
As you may know, you can use Kalzit to easily set up a little web-server for your home. Then, you can run apps written in the Kalzit programming language and access them through your server. This is supposed to make your personal data easily accessible from all your devices, while still keeping your data private.

In previous versions of Kalzit, communication between your devices and your home server worked over HTTP. Basically, this means that your data was sent in plain text - which can be a problem. If your data is sent in plain text, what would prevent someone from reading it?

The solution to that problem is the HTTPS protocol. It is basically the same as HTTP, but with an added S - which stands for "secure". It is a way to automatically encrypt the communication between your devices and a server, making it much harder for someone else to track what you are doing.


To get to the main point: Kalzit does now support HTTPS by default. You can choose which of the two communication options you want to use:

* For HTTP, use a URL like http://localhost:5000
* For HTTPS, use a URL like https://localhost:5001

One last thing about this: Every HTTPS server needs a certificate, which can either be self-signed or signed by a third-party authority.
By default, browsers do not trust sites which use self-signed certificates.
Please know that your Kalzit home server uses a self-signed certificate. You will have to tell your browser that you trust that certificate.
So, please do not be surprised if your browser warns you that your connection is "not secure" - this is normal behavior. You can simply accept the certificate and use the page normally.

## Direct testing of example code
While the automatic HTTPS support is probably the most important feature of this release, there are many other improvements as well.
For example, you will find that many more APIs are documented.

If you are using your Kalzit server to look at the documentation files, there is another nice feature called "Try in Kalzit Playground", which allows you to instantly try example code by clicking on a link next to it. You will be taken to the Kalzit playground, where you can edit and run that code. No need to copy-paste examples into files just to know what they do!

Some parts of the API documentation (like [speechSay](/docs/jsLibrary/speech_say.md), which allows you to read text to the user) already support this feature. Eventually, this feature should be present wherever you see example code.

## Better APIs for storing and handling modifiable lists
Talking about APIs: there are many new APIs to make your coding experience with Kalzit a lot better.
One area which was worked on is the handling of modifiable lists. It is now possible to easily store lists of strings, and there are pre-made controls which let the user edit any string list.
To demonstrate a few of these new features, here is the code of a simple app which allows you to create, say, a grocery list.

You can just copy the code below into a file named groceries.k, place that in the "apps" folder inside the Kalzit directory,
and then run it by opening http://localhost:5000/app/groceries in your browser. Here is the entire app:

```
`We create a stored list of strings`
$groceryList = storedModifiableStringList: "grocery-list".

`We show a list-editor to the user`
print: uiModifiableStringListEditor: groceryList.

`That is it! We made a fully functional grocery list`
```

When using the app, it will look like this - quite nice for so little code:

## Removed flag annotations
Next up: annotations. In the Kalzit programming language, annotations can have two meanings:

```kalzit
`They can be function calls (function annotations)`
$f = {print: x}.
@f 5. `Causes 5 to be printed`

void
```

```kalzit
`They can attach pieces of information to values`
`This variant is called an array annotation`

$v = 5.
@("unit";"km") v.
$unit of calcitAnnotations: v. `Result is "km"`
```

In previous language versions, there was also a third possible meaning:

```
`Example for flag annotations (which were removed)`

$flagTest = {print: x}.
@("flag" ; "text") x. `Caused 5 to be printed`

void
```

As you can see, this achieved basically the same effect which you can get from function annotations.
However, the above code *looks* like it should not have any output - why should there be a special kind of array annotation (after all, we are using an array as the annotation value) which then has the effect of a function annotation?
This is just confusing and hard to read, which is why flag annotations were removed in this version of Kalzit. So now, `@("flag" ; "text")` works the same way any other array annotation does.

# Fixed usability issues when installing the project
There are some bug fixes in this version, but the most important thing to fix was the installation process.

If you ever tried to install Kalzit, you might have noticed that this was not exactly a nice experience. You had to download the installer, and then you had to blindly trust it to not do something bad.
This release tries to solve a few of these problems. First of all, you do not need to download an installer file anymore if you do not want to. You can just go into a terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to install Kalzit, and run the following command:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triploit/Kalzit/master/utilities/installer/main.sh | sh`

This will start the installation process. The installer does now give more information about what it is doing - for example, every time you are asked to enter a "sudo" password, it will tell you what it tries to do with that.
Additionally, many issues which are likely to occur after installation were found, and in some cases there are now explanations about what to do when they occur. One common example was that the "node" command could not be found immediately after installing Kalzit - this issue should be much easier to resolve now.

Oh, and you can also install this project using the [Tridymite package manager](https://www.github.com/triploit/Tridymite) if you like:

```
tridy -i triploit:Kalzit
```

# Versioning system
The final point of the changelog is this: the project does now have a versioning system which is not based on the release date, but on the kind of the changes that were made.

For example, the current version is `0.6.0`. The first zero means that this project is still in beta, and not really ready for mass adoption. It will change to `1` with the first release which is stable and tested enough for that.

While the project is still in its early phase, the second number increases if breaking changes occur (like the removal of an API or language feature), while the third one increases for releases that only include fixes.

The final versioning system is supposed to work like this:

* The first number increases with breaking changes (you can not be certain that everything from release `1.0.0` works in release `2.0.0`)
* The second number increases when functionality was added (you *can* be certain that everything from release `1.0.0` works in `1.1.0`)
* The third number increases when a release only fixes bugs or other issues. That indicates that no big functional changes were done.

When a number increases, all numbers after it become zero (`0`). So, if the current version is `1.2.4` and a new release introduces new features but no breaking changes, it will have the version number `1.3.0`.
