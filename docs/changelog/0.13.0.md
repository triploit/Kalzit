# Kalzit 0.13.0 Changelog
Hello! It is time for another release of Kalzit. This release introduces a really cool feature for developers as well as several other changes which were made to make the project easier to maintain.
With no further ado, here we go:

# Better and automated build process
This feature is really great for anyone who is using Kalzit to develop a web app (meaning probably just for me at the moment).
In previous versions of Kalzit, you had this development cycle:

Make a change -> Build the app -> Restart the app -> See the result

This is pretty standard stuff. Well, with this release, you have a much shorter cycle, which is essentially this:

Make a change -> See the result

That is it! You can basically skip all the annoying things while developing, and you can see the effect of your changes pretty much immediately.
I think every developer who has had to work with the previous cycle will know how much time and annoyances this feature might save - essentially, it makes coding much more fun.

On a technical level, of course, things like that do not just happen. Several new features had to be added:
* There is now a script to automatically build an app when a source file changes (can be started with `kalzit run appBuildService`)
* That utility listens to changes of specified files and folders and triggers the appropriate build actions
* To make the process fast, you can now build much more selectively - as an example, you get the option to just build a specific app instead of all apps. (`kalzit build app myApp`, for example, instead of `kalzit build apps`)
* A running browser app will now check if there is a new version of the app (true after a build) and reload automatically if that is the case, so you can see the changes. (This only happens with a "localhost" URL)

Once again, as a user of this feature, you will hopefully not notice any of that. You can make your changes and see their effects - just as it should be.
You can activate this automatic app building service by running `kalzit run appBuildService` from the terimal.

# New APIs
To make the app building feature possible, a few new libraries were added:
* An API for file change listening (`fileListenFile`)
* A basic API for listening to folder changes (`nativeFileListenFolderAsync`)
* An API to get the host name of a URL (`urlGetHostName`)

# New "ide" app
Kalzit comes with an "ide" app which you can use to run little code snippets. This app was there since the beginning of the project; it originally existed to test if the Kalzit programming language worked as intended.
Now the programming language does work reliably, and so it was time to re-create something similar in Kalzit. The new playground app also has an additional documentation view, so you can use the same app to browse the documentation files which you would use to test little code ideas.
This was the original purpose of the separate "docs" app, which has now been removed.

Also, there is now an option to test longer code snippets:

You can then see the result of your snippet by clicking "Preview as expression". This is really convenient for creating new UI elements.
Since the IDE app is now a Kalzit app, you can of course sign in with your account and access your current code snippet from any of your devices.

Obviously, you can still use the app like you did before, with multiple single-line input fields (sort of like a read-eval-print loop; you have to press enter to see a result):

I hope you enjoy the new features of this app.

# Clean-up
The rest of the changes were pretty much only made for maintenance purposes - in other words, they hopefully make it easier to keep working on Kalzit without too many problems.
The changes are probably pretty boring for most, but interesting for some. So here they are in a compact list, without too many extra words:

## Feature removal
Removed the utilities to make mac apps
Removed the utilities to set mac file icons
Removed Tridymite support (Tridymite is apparently not in active development anymore)
Removed assets/images since they are already integrated in globalButtons.txt
Removed shasum saving from the CSS minify script
Removed all the Appcache-manifest stuff from the app build script
Removed the "siteId" and "siteUrl" server APIs
Removed the "cache web resources" feature (unnecessary)
Removed the "autocomplete" script
Removed the "htmlgen" API (never used)

Removed several deprecated libraries, including:
* Removed some old Reddit APIs
* Removed uiEditableStringList and uiLiveListView
* Removed the visualizers / show

Removed the "standalone" app features; cleaner code
Removed the server threading; does not match the use case
Removed the special print styling (for actual printers); does not match the use case
Removed the (unnecessary) service worker
Removed support for running .k files directly from the server

## File organization
Moved the "head.html" file to html5/files/head.html
Moved "getRidOfRedirects.sh" to the utilities folder
Moved APIs/packages/ui to its own library (browser-only)

## Little things (optimization, fixes, etc.)
Added a "scope" section to README
Fixed a few APIs that became broken
Fixed errors with the YouTube API
Made the Markdown runner cause less HTTP requests
Fixed several bugs (big-thumbnail KMP view did not work with the keptArguments KalzitMediaProtocol-field, for example)
Bug fixes with kmpGetArgumentsExtension and "api/userVideosKmp"
Added a fallback to uiKmpListWithBigThumbnails in case a video has no title
The "relaunchApp" API does now use "reload" instead of "redirect" (more reliable)
Prevented Kalzit scripts from running as root
Added a basic server setup guide
