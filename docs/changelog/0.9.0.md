# Changelog for version 0.9.0
It is time for a new release of Kalzit! It has been a few months since the last one came out, and a lot of things have been done.
Here are some of the most important changes:

# UI / UX improvements
Why are we starting with UI and UX stuff? Because it is important. For those who do not know, UX means user experience. Essentially, if you have ever thought "wow, this app is really bad", it had bad UX.
I think it is obvious that you do not want that, no matter if you are a user or a developer of an app. But creating a great user experience can be very hard, because as a developer, you usually have to do a lot of things manually in order to achieve it.
This manual work is annoying, and if it gets too bad, developers often say "well, I will just leave it as is - it is kind of bad, but at least it's working somehow". At least, that is what I do.
With this release of Kalzit, a lot of the things that had to be done manually before are now surprisingly easy to do. Here are a few examples:

## Loading indicator
Waiting for something to load is annoying. You know what is even more annoying? Not knowing *if* anything is loading at all, or if you are just waiting without the app doing anything. This is probably one of the biggest reasons why loading indicators are a thing.
Usually, the things that need a noticeable time to load are network requests. For example, if an app is triggering a web search, that might take a little while to complete. It would be nice if users knew that some networking stuff is currently going on, so they at least know that something is happening.
Seeing that something is happening actually makes it much easier to endure a relatively long loading time.

In order to make users aware that something is currently loading, a loading indicator will now be shown below all toolbars. The best thing about this is that you do not have to change anything about your app as a developer. You just trigger your (asynchronous) network request with the standard functions (`loadLocalAsync` or `loadGlobalAsync`), and the loading indicator shows up automatically. As soon as all open requests are done, it disappears again.
If you need to trigger a network request without any loading indicator showing up (say for a background content update), you can do that as well. You can use the function `loadLocalAsyncWithoutIndicator` if you really have to, but usually that is not necessary.

I think this is a good thing for both users and developers.

## Three-dot buttons
Another thing which can be useful are menus. Kalzit has supported a certain kind of menu for a while now: the dropdown list.

![Screenshot of a dropdown list](/docs/images/0.9.0/uiActionPicker.png)
*(If the image looks pixelated, it has been zoomed in automatically)*

However, there are other kinds of menus as well. Many mobile applications use a vertical line of three dots to indicate that a menu will open when you tap these dots. After that, you can select a menu item and trigger an action.

The new version of Kalzit makes things like that relatively easy. Not as easy as they should be, but *relatively* easy when compared to what was supported before. Here is an example:
```kalzit
`We want to have a three-dot button`
`We get that using the "uiActionPickerWithIcon" function`
$myMenu = {
	
	`This function is called when the user selects one of the options`
	$selectedOption = Int: x. `In the current version, x is a string, so we convert it to a number`
	
	`Find out what to do now`
	``
	$appropriateAction = first: selectedOption switchEq
		[0; {popupMessage: "You triggered option one"}];
		[1; {popupMessage: "You triggered option two"}].
		
	do: appropriateAction.
		
} uiActionPickerWithIcon ["Option one"];["Option two"].

`Show the three-dot button!`
print: myMenu.
```

Here is an image of the result - might be zoomed in a bit:

![Screenshot of the output produced by uiActionPickerWithIcon](/docs/images/0.9.0/uiActionPickerWithIcon.png)
*(If the image looks pixelated, it has been zoomed in automatically)*

If you don't know, the code above is pretty similar to what you would use for writing a dropdown list that is connected to a callback (`uiActionPicker`). With these new three-dot buttons, there are two main differences to that:
* The three-dot button does not remember what option was selected last time, so you can trigger the same option multiple times in a row. There is also no tick shown to mark the last selected option.
* The three-dot button is a lot smaller (20 pixels wide by default) and it shows a vertical line of three dots instead of text.

So now we can implement a really common and useful UI element with relative ease. On that note, here is another one of those:

## Sidebars
Most people who read this probably know what a sidebar is and what it looks like. If not, here is a screenshot of an app with a sidebar:
![Screenshot of an app with a sidebar](/docs/images/0.9.0/sidebar.png)

The sidebar takes up the entire left area of an app - it occupies a part of the toolbar (in this example, there is a text field shown there) and a part of the main app view (in this case, there is a list of notes).
What you can not see in this screenshot is that you can resize sidebars, and you can even hide them completely if you do not need them. If you are on a narrow window (usually this means you are using a phone), the sidebar hides automatically to make more space for your content.

Okay, so that is the user side of sidebars. How do you implement them as a developer? This is made sort of easy with the new `leftSidebarManager` API.
Basically, a sidebar manager takes care of most things that have to do with sidebars. You can set it up like this:

```kalzit
`This is our main app content`
$mainContent = uiContainer: "This is the main app - next to the sidebar".

`We create a sidebar manager`
$sidebarManager = leftSidebarManager:
	[$sidebarViews; [
		uiContainer: "Hey, this is shown in the sidebar!"
	]];
	[$mainContent; mainContent].

`Prepare the toolbar`
toolsAtLeft:
	[$tool propOf sidebarManager];
	[!leftSidebarToggleButtonTool].
	
`Show the UI elements`
print: !uiGlobalToolbar.
print: $sidebar propOf sidebarManager.
print: mainContent.
```

Run that code, and you have a basic app with a sidebar! You will notice that the main content is layed out to be at the bottom of the page; that can be changed by putting `@(height: "100% - " + toolbarCmHeight + "cm")` in front of it, then it should take up the full right area except for the toolbar space.

I think these three (loading indicators, three-dot buttons and sidebars) will be the most important new UI APIs in this release. But there are several more I want to mention:

## More advanced list editors
With [version 0.6.0 of Kalzit](/docs/changelog/0.6.0.md), the `uiModifiableStringListEditor` function was introduced. That API works really well for editing simple string lists, but for other cases it is just too limiting.
To solve that issue, it is now possible to create custom string list editors with the `uiCustomModifiableStringListEditor` function (`customModifiableListEditTool` for the toolbar).
These two functions need a modifiable list (of any kind) as their first parameter, and a configuration object as the second. The configuration object can have the following properties:

- `$toStringConverter` (converts each item of the list to a string)
- `$fromStringConverter` (converts a string to a valid list item)
- `$onTap` (when an item is selected - gets the selected index as parameter)
- `$onAddition` (triggered when an item is added)
- `$onRemoval` (triggered when an item is removed)
- `$title` (for `customModifiableListEditTool` only)

These options should enable you to use many more kinds of list with the string list editor.

## Separators
Sometimes it can be useful to add separator lines. One example could be for lists with different kinds of items, or articles with different sections. There are now APIs for that:
* `uiHorizontalSeparator` (separates horizontally layed out items) / `uiVerticalSeparator` (separates vertically layed out items)
* `separatorTool` to separate different categories of tools (applies to both the mobile and desktop toolbars)

## Popup variants
In case you want to have small popups, or you need a kind of popup that does not exist yet, there are now many more popup options:
* `uiBasicPopup` (displays anything as a popup; no popup sizes or special stylings)
* `uiLargePopup` (big popups, the same as `uiPopup`) / `uiSmallPopup` (small popups, for things like info texts)

## Notification APIs
Many browsers support native notifications - the things that pop into your screen, separate from the app window. This can be very useful if an app wants to work in the background and notify the user when it is done, for example.
In order to allow you to send notifications, this release includes multiple notification-related APIs:

* `notificationSupported` / `notificationForbidden` / `notificationAllowed` to figure out if you are able to use notifications
* `notificationRequestPermission` to make the browser ask the user for notification permissions.
* `notificationShowShortText` / `notificationShowLongText` to show text notifications

The coolest notification-related function, however, is `showMessage`. This function is also used to display short text content, but it can decide for itself if that should be done as a popup or as a notification. Say you run this code:
```
showMessage: "Hello! This is a little message for you."
```
If you do that in a browser without notification support, or if there are no permissions given by the user, a popup will be shown:
![Screenshot of a standard popup message](/docs/images/0.9.0/uiSmallPopup.png)

If the user has given you the permission to send notifications, a native notification will be shown instead.
You can also make the user know why you would like to send notifications:
```
"Main notification text" showMessage "I would like to send notifications instead of annoying popups. Do you want to allow that?"
```
In case you do not have notifications enabled, you will first see the message as a popup, and after that you will see this dialog:

![Screenshot of a notification permission question](/docs/images/0.9.0/notificationPermissionPopup.png)

Only after clicking "Allow notifications" will the browser ask for the actual permission. The point is, the user actually knows *why* the app wants notification permissions; which makes the user much more likely to accept. I think this will make notifications much more popular with Kalzit apps than they would be otherwise.

# Other things
Okay, that was a lot of UI stuff. Now we can take a quick look at other improvements, starting with:

## Server improvements
Since Kalzit is not only a programming environment but also home server software, there have been some server-side improvements.
As an example, your accounts have been made a bit more secure by invalidating your sessions whenever the server restarts - if nothing else, that might help you to remember your password since you could have to use it a little more often.
Also, the server has become much better at serving large files. Previously, the server tried to load the entire file into memory before serving it, which is really not practical. Now, the server uses less RAM to serve the exact same file, and this also causes systems with rather little RAM to crash a less often.

## App-specific CSS files
These next few things are for the developers again. Firstly, you can now add a default styling file to any app project. Simply go to your project folder and add a `<appId>.css` file - any style rule you add to that file will apply to your application!
If your app has the id `demo`, the CSS file would be called `demo.css`.
This allows you to completely customize the look and feel of Kalzit applications, while still not having to re-design everything yourself. You can keep the default Kalzit styling you like, but you are now free to change what you do not like.

## Smaller app icon files (less bandwidth)
Your Kalzit apps can have their own icon, which allows you to customize its appearance on the iOS home screen, for example. This is a good thing, but it was not implemented very well.
One problem that existed was that the icons had a standard size of 512x512 pixels. It does not sound like much, but it still took a considerable amount of time to load these icons, especially from a slow server.
Since a size of 512x512 is a bit unnecessary anyway, it has been reduced to 128x128 pixels. This helps to reduce bandwidth and nobody I have shown this has noticed any difference, so it should be an overall improvement.

## Cacheing of many internet assets (with https)
Do you know what is annoying? Waiting. As in, sitting there and not being able to do the thing you want because an app is just slower than it should be. This situation has already become less annoying because of the [loading indicators](#loading-indicator) mentioned above, but the problem is still the same: you still have to wait. So I tried to come up with a way to avoid that.
When you are using an app that displays data from the internet, it makes sense that the app loads that data from the internet. But for some apps, you might not care if the displayed stuff is up-to-date. You might prioritize speed over recency - and now, you have the option to choose between the two!
The way this is implemented is simple: whenever you go to your account preferences, a new checkbox will be there:

![Screenshot of the data-reuse checkbox](/docs/images/0.9.0/dataReuseCheckbox.png)

If you check that box, the app will automatically default to using old data - if available - when the app tries to load a resource. When that is the case, it will attempt to refresh the resource in the background, so more recent data can be shown the next time. This might be useful to some users wo really do not want to wait.

## Minus sign can now be used to negate numbers
This last section has to do with a really core part of Kalzit: negating numbers. That is a thing which every programming language should be able to do, and Kalzit has never made it really convenient.
But that is changing now, because the standard `-` function (for subtracting numbers) can now be used to negate numbers as well!
Basically, if you use the `-` function with one parameter, it will negate that parameter. So, if you write `3 - 1` you will still get `2`, as expected, but if you write `(-5)`, you get negative five! Of course, this also works in conjunction with other functions: `(- 5 + 7)` would be negative 12, because `5 + 7` is 12, and the `-` function negates that. It is a small change, but it makes coding certain things much less annoying.

# End of the changelog
And that is it! If you have read the entire changelog - which was really long, I know - I want to say thank you. Maybe you have found some things you like, or some you do not like - in any case, I would like to know what you think. You can tell me your opinion on any of the changes by sending an E-Mail to oplpublishergerman@gmail.com, it would be really appreciated. Or you could open an Issue on GitHub.
Anyway, I hope you have fun with Kalzit! Thank you again for reading, have a good day.
