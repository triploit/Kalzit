This is one of the biggest Kalzit releases yet, so this changelog focuses only on the major new features to keep it reasonably short.
Things like bug fixes and features which most users will not really notice are deliberately left out.

# User interface redesign
Many changes were made to make the user interface look nicer.
In order to show some of the changes, I will show some screenshots of a note-taking app that is currently in development.
This way, you can see what the old version looked like, and what it looks like with the new UI.
You will be able to use most of these features in your apps without much effort.

## Visual redesign
Okay, here we go! This is what the old version of the note-taking app looked like. It was built with Kalzit 0.6.0 (the last major version):
![Screenshot of the notes app (old version)](/docs/images/0.6.0/mainApp.png)
And here is the same app - really, this did not require too many code changes - in Kalzit 0.7.0 (this version):
![Screenshot of the notes app (new version)](/docs/images/0.7.0/mainApp.png)
You might have noticed some of the changes already:
* The text on the buttons is bigger and the contrast between the text and the button itself is higher, which makes the text much easier to read
* The toolbar and the note area do now have rounded corners, so the app looks more pleasant
* The toolbar is a little bit smaller than before, leaving more space for the content

So, let's say you click on the "Edit note list..." button. This is what the old version looked like:
![Screenshot of the note list editor (old version)](/docs/images/0.6.0/stringListEditor.png)
And here is the new version:
![Screenshot of the note list editor (new version)](/docs/images/0.7.0/stringListEditor.png)
The app uses the standard list editor (`uiModifiableStringListEditor` and its variants) to show this dialog. Here is a list of some of the changes made:
* The textfield (used for adding notes) is now wider and lines up with the text content below, which makes the dialog look much better
* There is now a little gap between the textfield and the "Add" button, so the dialog looks more in line with the main toolbar (shown in the screenshots above)
* The corners of the dialog are rounded now, so it looks more pleasant

To see some more changes, we can close the popup (by clicking on the background or going "back" in the browser) and click on the "account" button (the little person icon on the right). In this case, the difference between the versions is not as pronounced, so I will only show you the new version:
![Screenshot of the login window](/docs/images/0.7.0/login.png)

----------

The real difference here will be visible when you click on the "Register a new user" button. This button is very important, because many of the Kalzit features only work with an account.
In previous versions, you were taken to a completely new page, which looked rather ugly:
![Screenshot of the registration window (old version)](/docs/images/0.6.0/register.png)
In this Kalzit version, you get this:
![Screenshot of the registration window (new version)](/docs/images/0.7.0/register.png)
I think you get the point - you do not get kicked out of the app anymore. Also, the login screen does look a lot better now.

Now we have explored some UI changes, but we only focused on the "desktop" experience. If you use Kalzit on a phone - or in a rather narrow browser window - some apps will look a bit different. Here is what that was like previously:
![Screenshot of the notes app in a narrow window (old version)](/docs/images/0.6.0/mainAppMobile.png)
This is what it looks like now:
![Screenshot of the notes app in a narrow window (new version)](/docs/images/0.7.0/mainAppMobile.png)
The most important change is that the "menu" and "account" buttons do now line up with the edges of the note area - or with whatever other content is there. In previous versions, they looked completely off. Also, the rounded corners on the toolbar and the text area are much easier to see in this screenshot.

If you click on the menu button on the left, you get to your app controls - which you know already from looking at the desktop version. Here is what that looks like in the new version - once again, notice the rounded corners, which were not there previously:

------

So, these are some of the visual UI changes that were made. However, not all of the changes can be shown as a screenshot. Which includes:

## Animated popups
This is probably not hard to understand - popups do now have an animation for opening and closing. If you want to see what it looks like, click [here](/docs/images/0.7.0/popupAnimation.mp4).

A little tip for the developers: In order to get the opening animation, please show your popups with the `uiShowPopup` function:

```
$myPopup = uiPopup: "This is very basic".

`Instead of doing this ...`
print: myPopup. `Not animated`

`... do this:`
uiShowPopup: myPopup. `animated`
```

You do not have to do anything else - you will get the animation when it is appropriate, and - which is equally important - you will not get it when transitioning between popups. So, if you open a new popup while another one is open, there will be no animation, just as the user would expect it.

## Keyboard navigation
Another important thing is keyboard navigation. Some people might not be able to use a mouse - or the might just not want to do so. These people should still be able to use the Kalzit apps.
So, in the new version, you can use the following keys to navigate:

* Tab - to go from one element to the next. Previously, you could not select image buttons (like the account button) this way - that is now possible, making the apps much more accessible
* Enter - to "click" on an element. Once again, if you tried to activate an image button this way, it did not work
* Escape - to close a popup window. In previous versions you had to use the browser "back" button or click on the space behind the popup. Pressing escape is a lot more intuitive.

# Digital wellbeing
Now that we are done with the UI stuff, we can focus on something else: health.
Health is a lot more important than any kind of user interface, but nowadays computers have the potential to influence it - both positively and negatively.
Positive examples include things like digital entertainment, which, when used appropriately, can make us happy. Especially in the year 2020 (for those who read it in that year, you know what I mean) computers made it possible to work from home instead of risking your health at work.

However, there are also bad things. For example, it is very, *very* tempting to just use the computer for a really long period of time. Why stop using it when it can provide an infinite amount of easily accessible entertainment, right?
Consequences of this can include a bad posture (usually the screen is not positioned high enough for you to sit straight), headaches, and the unpleasant feeling of not having accomplished anything all day. Why not attempt to tackle some of these computer-related problems?
After all, I am someone who is able to write software *and* see some of the potential problems it causes.

So, here are some health-related things I implemented in this version of Kalzit:

## Logout
Kalzit makes it rather easy now to set up an account and log in with it.
Previously, you could not really do too much with your account. Clicking on the account button after logging in only gave you this message: You are already logged in.
There was no option to log out. Constantly being logged in with your - private - account is already a thing that can cause stress. So, there is now a "Logout" button - you can get to it by clicking on the account button in the toolbar. A two-click logout is probably not bad to have.

![Screenshot of the account window](/docs/images/0.7.0/accountPreferences.png)

You get something else as well by clicking on the account button: preferences. Here, you can enable features which are supposed to help you use Kalzit in a more healthy way. Currently, there is just one preference, but more are planned for the future. Let us take a look at your (one) option:

## App time-out
This feature is supposed to help you use your devices a little bit less. Not by showing you how much you have used them already - this does not work for most people, and it feels bad to see that you have not reached your own goals.
Instead, Kalzit will help you take little breaks from the computer, in regular intervals.

![Screenshot of the timeout checkbox](/docs/images/0.7.0/timeoutCheckbox.png)

If you check this checkbox, the following will happen: after 30 minutes of (total) app usage, the Kalzit apps will block you from accessing them. Of course, they will tell you why, and when you will be able to access them again (in about 20 minutes).
This is much more helpful than a blocker with the option to use the app anyway. Maybe it can help you to use your devices less. Of course, you can disable or enable the option whenever you want to - except when your timeout is active. It is just meant to be helpful, not to be annoying.

In the future, other helpful tools to use your devices in a healthier way will be implemented. Your settings are synchronized between your devices if you use the same Kalzit account, so you do not have to check the tickbox on every new device you get. You can also not cheat your way around the timeout by simply switching to another device.

# Important changes for developers
Most of the things mentioned here were not really developer-related.
Since there are some interesting new language and API features, this will change now.

## Removed the special meaning of underscore
In the Kalzit programming language, you can create a function like this:
```
$doStuff = !fun ($value) {
	print: first: value.
	print: second: value.
}.
```

However, doing that would have a potentially unintended consequence in previous versions: this function would not work well with lists.
So, if you wanted to use the function like this:

```
doStuff: "A";"B".
```

You might expect to see the output `A` followed by `B`, because you told the function to print the first and second value of its parameter.
Instead, you would have seen this in previous versions:
```
A
A
B
B
```

While this behavior made sense when you knew the rules behind it, this is really not very intuitive.
To make it worse, this behavior actually changed depending on the parameter name. If you had a parameter name that started with an underscore (`_`), the function worked as expected:

```
$doStuff = !fun ($_value `noteice the leading underscore`) {
	print: first: _value.
	print: second: _value.
}.

doStuff: "A";"B".
```

For a language that claims to be simple and easy to learn, this is not a good thing. So in this version, the special meaning of the underscore `_` was removed.
Both of the functions above will now have the exact same effect - and they will *both* work as originally intended. So they will both output `A` followed by `B`.

## Breaking changes of the sub-app API
This next thing is very specific to one API: `registerMobileTool` (or all other ways to add tools to the mobile toolbar).
In previous versions, you could do something like this:

```
{
	openSubApp: "somethingElse"
} registerMobileTool "My fancy tool".
```

This tool would have caused the sub-app `somethingElse` to open. However, this functionality came with a lot of compromizes.
For example, there was an ugly flicker before the intended sub-app was actually shown. It also required a lot of weird code to work (in the API implementation), and finally, it prevented the new popup animations from working as intended.

What does this mean for you as a developer? It means that you can *not* open sub-apps from mobile tools anymore.
You can, of course, still trigger code ...
```
{print: "Done". void} registerMobileTool "My action"
```
... and you can also cause views to be shown inside a popup:
```
{"Anything other than 'void' should be shown"} registerMobileTool "Test"
```

In most cases, this change should not cause too many problems. And you get all of the fancy animations, rounded corners, etc. for free!

## Installing apps from the Internet (prototype)
Last - but certainly not least - is a tool to install apps from the internet.
You can use this from the command line: `kalzit install app <url>` (or `./cli install app <url>`).
In order to install an app this way, two things are required: A text file `<url>/doNotTouch/appId.txt` which contains the ID of this app (should be unique to your app), and another text file `<url>/doNotTouch/fileListing.txt` which contains a list of all files that make up the app.
The reason this is marked as a prototype is because the app structure is not really final yet, and because other features connected to it are not yet finished. As an example, the newly installed app does not show up on your home screen automatically.

This sounded very theoretical, so here is a practical demo: https://github.com/NetLamp-Y/KalzitTestApp

There is also another thing to this: by creating a new app project (`kalzit new app <appFolderPath> <appId>`), all the required files will be automatically generated. You can just code your app and upload it to a server, and other users can easily install it!

# Plans for the future
With all these new features, Kalzit is now a lot closer to reaching its first major version (the plans for this are listed [here](/docs/future/1.0.0.md)).
Plans for version 2.0.0 do exist, but they are not fully finished yet. You can look at them [by clicking on this link](/docs/future/2.0.0.md).

Since this is an open-source project, you can help reach these goals, or you can help finding new ones. Or you could just use Kalzit in its current form - it would be very much appreciated. If you notice any bugs, please feel free to report them. Thank you for being interested in this project!
