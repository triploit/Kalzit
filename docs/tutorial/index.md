If you want to learn this language, here is a list of links you might find useful.

As a newcomer, you probably want to go through this list in the given order.
You will get to know the main usecases of the language, and how to write good code in it.

If you are familiar with certain topics already, feel free to use this page to look up any sort of detail you might need.
It should serve both purposes well.

## Setup

* [Development environments](/docs/environments/overview.md)
* [Browser IDE vs. standalone app](/docs/environments/browserIdeVsStandalone.md)

Please choose any environment you like. It is probably easiest to use the [Browser IDE](/app/ide), because the examples will assume you do.
The "Hello World" section will show you what to do when not using the Browser IDE.

Have fun!
