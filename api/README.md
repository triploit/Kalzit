# The /api folder
In this folder, you can find many server-side APIs which allow your client apps to communicate with the server.
Currently, the content of this folder is modeled after how the /api handle worked previously.
In that previous implementation, APIs had no file extension. This is achieved by using a folder with the API name, and placing an "index.ks" file inside that folder.

In later versions, the API implementations might be transitioned to be easier to work with (with files named apiName.ks, for example).
