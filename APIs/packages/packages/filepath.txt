`For the moment, a file path is the same as a string - this will probably change later`
$FilePath = String.

#{
	This function performs a few checks to try to prevent a file path from being misused.
	Right now, the only thing it does is see if the path contains "../" - this can be used to go up a level in the folder hierarchy, possibly allowing someone to get to a place where they are not supposed to go.
	Therefore, a path containing "../" is considered unsafe.
	
	If a path is considered unsafe, void is returned (as there is no guaruanteed way to make it safe).
	If a path is considered safe, the path itself is returned.
	
	Plesae note that this function can never make entierely sure that a path is indeed safe.
	Rather, it just detects cases that might be unsafe.
