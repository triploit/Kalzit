#{
	This annotation rounds the corners of a UI element.
	How much of it gets round is specified by a percentage.
	
	The effect is most easily shown with a square.
	A rectangular UI element could be created like this:
	
	$rect = @(backgroundColor red) @(pxWidth 200) @(pxHeight 200) uiContainer: ().
	
	If we want to add rounded corners, and take up 10 percent of each side to do it, we could write this:
	
	@(percentRoundness 10) rect.
	
	To make this more extreme, we can also make the square into a circle.
	This can be done by making 100 percent of each side into a rounded thing:
		
	@(percentRoundness 100) rect.
	
	It is important to note that this annotation does not grant that the rounded corners look "evenly" rounded.
	To understand this better, you should also try this code - which does use a rectangle with longer and shorter sides:
		
	@(percentRoundness 30) @(backgroundColor red) @(pxWidth 200) @(pxHeight 300) uiContainer: ().
	
	The absolute size of the corners does scale with the element - use @pxRoundness to prevent that.
}
$percentRoundness = {flag: ["percentRoundness"];[x]}.

#{
	This annotation rounds the corners of a UI element.
	The radius of the rounded corners is defined by a pixel count.
	
	If you want to add nice rounded corners to any graphical element, you can do this:
	
	@(pxRoundness 10) myElement.
	
	Now, if your element is 20 pixels wide and tall, it will look like a little circle.
	If it is bigger, only the corners will appear rounded.
	
	The absolute size of the corners does not scale with the element - use @percentRoundness for that.
