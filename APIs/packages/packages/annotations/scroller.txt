#{
	This annotation allows the content of a uiContainer to scroll vertically, if they need more space than they get.
	
	For example, if you create an element that is restricted in height:
	
	@(pxHeight 200) uiContainer: 1 to 40.
	
	Then you will only be able to see the first few numbers - you can not scroll down.
	If you want to scroll down, simply add this annotation:
		
	@verticalScroller
	@(pxHeight 200) @verticalScroller uiContainer: 1 to 40.
}
$verticalScroller = flag: ["vertical_scroller"]
