/* @kalzit.for urlTitleAsync

	Obtains the title of a URL in an asynchronous way.
	The title is obtained by reading the contents of the "title" HTML tag in the referenced website.
	
	To handle the title information, you can specify a callback which is called with the title as its first parameter.
	If no title can be found, the first parameter is the original URL itself.
	
	Usage example:
		{
			popupMessage: "The found title is " + x.	
		} urlTitleAsync "https://www.duckduckgo.com".
