/* @kalzit.for divisors
	Takes a list of positive integers and returns all numbers these are divisible by.
	
	For example, the numbers 8 and 16 are all divisible by 2, 4 and 8.
	Of course, 1 would always work, so that is excluded from the result.
	
	So, this example will produce the expected result:
	divisors: 8;16.
	`Result: 2;4;8`

/* @kalzit.for gcd
	Calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) that works for all numbers in a given array of numbers.
	
	Example:
	gcd: 8;16.
