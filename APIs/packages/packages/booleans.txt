	Turns a boolean into its opposite.
	This is done by comparing a value to zero (meaning "false").
	Everything expect zero will produce false (0), only zero produces true (1) as its opposite.
	
	Examples:
	```
	not: true.
	`Result: 0`
	```
	
	```
	not: false
	`Result: 1`
	```
	
	```
	not: "Test".
	`Result: 0`
	```
