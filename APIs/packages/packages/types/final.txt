/* @kalzit.for Final

	A type function that describes an unchanging value.
	
	For example, if you want to have an unchanging variable of type int, you can do this:
		$var ? (Final:Int) = 5.
	
	If you attempt to change that variable from now on, the actual value will not change - the type function will remember the first value and always return it.
	It also works with any other type function.
