#{
	A type that describes an URL with a protocol.
	Basically, any URL is assumed to be a string.
	If the given string does not contain "://" - meaning it has no protocol - the text "https://" is added to the start.
	Otherwise, the original string is returned.
}
$url = ($u ? String) fun {("://" strContains u) ifElse {u};{"https://" + u}}.
