/* @kalzit.for app_parameter

	Gives access to the value of a named app parameter.
	For web applications, these parameters are placed behind the URL, separated by a question mark.
	Example: http://localhost:5000/app/myApp?name=value
	If this was the URL of your app, the following code would give you the string "value":
		appParameter: "name"
	In case you want to get parameters of another url, use the "urlGetParamter" function.
