/* @kalzit.for register_desktop_tool
	This function is used to register a tool that will later be added to a desktop toolbar.
	A tool is basically just a function that returns a UI element. This element is added to the toolbar.
	
	It is not guaranteed when exactly the toolFactory function is called.
	It might be before the toolbar is set up, during the setup process, or even after it is already visible.
	
	A tool implementation might look like this:
		registerDesktopTool: {@left {} uiButton "Button"}.
	
	To get all registered desktop tools, use "registeredDesktopTools".
	To get a toolbar overlay only for the desktop, use "generateDesktopOverlay".
	To get a toolbar for both mobile and desktop, where the desktop one uses the registered tools, use "uiGlobalToolbar".

/* @kalzit.for generate_desktop_toolbar_overlay
	Generates a toolbar overlay with a standardized layout for the desktop.
	This bar is only visible when the app window is wide enough for desktop controls, otherwise it is hidden.
	
	This toolbar is empty by default, except for two buttons on the right ("user" and "apps").
	To add custom tools for an app, use "registerDesktopTool".
	For more information about adding desktop tools, see the documentation of "registerDesktopTool".
	
	Please note that if you are making an app for mobile and desktop, you sould use "uiGlobalToolbar" instead of this function.
	It takes care of adding all necessary UI elements to make the toolbar look nice.
