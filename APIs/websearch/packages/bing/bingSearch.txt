	Searches for images using the Bing search engine.
	If you do not need to specifically search using Bing, but just want the result, consider using "webImageSearch" instead.
	
	Anyway, to get a list of found image URLs, you can do this:
	
	bingImageSearchUrls: "Search term"
}
$bingImageSearchUrls = $query fun {{"://" strContains x} filter imageStringsFromUrl: "https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=" + urlEncodeParameter: query}.
