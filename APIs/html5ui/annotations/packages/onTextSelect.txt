#{
	An annotation that causes a function to be called whenever a text is selected on a text input control.
	Working text input controls are text fields and text areas.
	
	@(onTextSelect: {popupMessage: "Text is " + x}) {} uiTextfieldOnaction {}.
	
	Warning: The function is triggered even if the user is not finished with the selection yet.
	For example, when selecting a longer portion of text, the listener is triggered many times.
	This means that you should not perform an action with big side effects that can not be undone here.
