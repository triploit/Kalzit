#{
	An annotation that allows to add a css class to a UI element.
	This currently depends on the web platform, so you should be careful if you want to use your code in other ways.
	
	Example:
	@(cssClass: "myClass") uiContainer: "Test".
	
	For many common things you are not going to need your own CSS classes.
	Stuff like centering text, sizing and positioning other elements and so on, already have their own annotations.
