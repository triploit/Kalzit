# ./utilities
## Purpose of this folder
This folder contains several command-line scripts which automate common tasks.
It is split up into two different categories:
* installer - includes scripts that are needed to install the Kalzit project
* cli - includes scripts for essentially everything else. These expect the project to be installed. They are accessible from the `./cli` command or from the global `kalzit command`. You can read more about this in the README of that folder.
